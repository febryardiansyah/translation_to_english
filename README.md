i made this using flutter (dart language) and firebase ML kit by google

Package that i use on this app :
- translator: ^0.1.4
- flutter_screenutil: ^1.0.2
- firebase_ml_vision: ^0.9.3+5
- image_picker: ^0.6.3+4

Bugs :
- Forceclose when using camera, use gallery instead
- App forceclose or stoped working when user cancel pick a picture

Maybe i'll add choices to choose dark or light mode later xD
